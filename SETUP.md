# BIMaided Setup Guide

## Initial Setup

Your BIMaided website and employee management system is ready! Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Create the First Admin User

To create your first admin account, run this SQL query in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace with your actual email and secure password
INSERT INTO auth.users (email, encrypted_password, email_confirmed_at, raw_user_meta_data)
VALUES (
  'admin@bimaided.com',
  crypt('YourSecurePassword123!', gen_salt('bf')),
  now(),
  '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
);

-- Get the user_id from the auth.users table
-- Replace USER_ID_HERE with the actual UUID from the query above
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('USER_ID_HERE', 'Admin');
```

Or create your admin user through the Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication → Users
2. Create a new user
3. Copy their user_id
4. Run: `INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('USER_ID_HERE', 'Admin');`

### 1.1 Fix Missing Employee Roles

If employees were created but cannot log in (getting "Role not found" error), run this SQL to assign the Employee role to all users who have an employee record but no role:

```sql
-- Assign Employee role to all employees who don't have a role yet
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT e.user_id, 'Employee'::user_role
FROM employees e
WHERE e.user_id IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur WHERE ur.user_id = e.user_id
  );
```

### 2. Add Departments and Designations

Before adding employees, set up your organizational structure:

```sql
-- Add Departments
INSERT INTO departments (name, description) VALUES 
  ('Architecture', 'Architectural design and BIM modeling'),
  ('Engineering', 'Structural and MEP engineering'),
  ('VDC', 'Virtual Design and Construction'),
  ('Human Resources', 'HR and administration'),
  ('Management', 'Project and business management');

-- Add Designations (get department_id from departments table)
INSERT INTO designations (name, level, department_id) VALUES 
  ('BIM Manager', 'Senior', 'DEPT_ID_HERE'),
  ('Senior Architect', 'Senior', 'DEPT_ID_HERE'),
  ('BIM Modeler', 'Mid', 'DEPT_ID_HERE'),
  ('Revit Technician', 'Junior', 'DEPT_ID_HERE');
```

- Two-tier approval prevents unauthorized leave

## Database Schema

The system includes these main tables:
- `employees` - Employee information (with supervisor_id for reporting manager)
- `departments` - Organizational departments
- `designations` - Job roles and positions
- `user_roles` - Role assignments (Admin/Employee)
- `salaries` - Compensation records
- `attendance` - Attendance and leave records (with supervisor & admin approval fields)
- `leave_balances` - Annual leave tracking
- `documents` - Employee documents
- `project_assignments` - Project allocations
- `emergency_contacts` - Emergency contact information
- **`projects`** - Portfolio projects with categories
- **`career_postings`** - Job openings

## Two-Tier Leave Approval Workflow

1. **Employee submits leave request** → Status: "Pending Supervisor"
2. **Reporting Manager reviews** → Can approve or reject
   - If rejected: Request deleted
   - If approved: `supervisor_approved = true`, Status: "Pending Admin"
3. **Admin reviews** → Final approval
   - If rejected: Request deleted
   - If approved: `admin_approved = true`, Status: "Fully Approved"
